As it's #WorldMentalHealthDay I encourage everyone who is struggling to try and book an appointment with a GP - get on that road! I know it can be scary, intimidating, embarrassing and/or cause anxiety - I cancelled two appointments before finally plucking up the courage... 

On #WorldMentalHealthDay, let us not forget the conscious cruelty the Tories have inflicted on mental health sufferers: £105 million less funding now than in 2012. 30% fewer beds for mental health patients  40% of mental health trusts have experienced cuts

Today is #WorldMentalHealthDay. Around 70% of autistic children and young people have mental health problems - and many autistic adults do too. It’s vital that they can get the support they need, from professionals who understand autism

It's #WorldMentalHealthDay today. Remember that even the happiest, smiliest and most confident people you know have days where they lose faith in themselves and don't feel comfortable in their own skin. Everyone is fighting their own battle, let's help each other out 

Please dont be afraid to speak to someone if your struggling no matter what the reason is. You're family & friends will want you in their lives not just a memory of you. Its Ok not to be Ok. Stay strong & ask for help its a sign of great strength to do so. #WorldMentalHealthDay

You cannot recover from anxiety by staying calm. You can not recover from depression by just being positive. You cannot recover from anorexia nervosa by eating more. If mental illness were that simple we wouldn’t be struggling in the first place. #WorldMentalHealthDay

Struggling with mental health was always a journey I kept to myself until recently, but opening up and seeking help got me to the good place I’m in today. It’s hard to talk about it but it’s even harder to go through it by yourself, lets break the stigma  #WorldMentalHealthDay.
